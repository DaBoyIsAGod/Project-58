        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I love reading books that are interesting and books that have lots of action. <br> I read books because it improves minds and I always feel relaxed while reading books, and it just takes me to a whole new world. <br> I read books that are VERY long, because I am then entertained longer and I don't have to keep looking through books. <br> And finally books are good because they have new and big words that you can learn and it will help you as you get older!</p>
